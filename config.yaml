# EXAMPLE
#
# feeds:
#  example: # The name of the feed (used in the instances section to mark feed to use)
#    url: 'https://example.com/rss'
#    pinCategories: 
#      - News: 7
#    content: 'summary'
#    datefield: 'pubDate'
#    joinfeeds: 
#      - 'example2' # the feed contains posts from example2, which we want. So we join example2 to get posts that are in both example and example2.
#    exclude:
#      - 'example3' # the feed contains posts from example3, which we don't want. So we exclude example3 to get posts that are in example only.
# 
#  example2:
#    url: 'https://example.com/rss2'
# 
#  example3:
#    url: 'https://example.com/rss3'
